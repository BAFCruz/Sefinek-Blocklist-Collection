## 💘 Dating website domains
Dating website domains are websites that specialize in helping people find romantic partners, friends, or casual relationships. These websites typically allow users to create profiles with personal information and photos, and to search for other users based on various criteria, such as age, gender, location, and interests. Some dating websites also offer matchmaking services, where algorithms are used to suggest potential matches based on user data. These domains are commonly used and can be allowed or blocked based on personal preferences.

Here's a sample list of dating site domains that you can block in Pi-hole:
