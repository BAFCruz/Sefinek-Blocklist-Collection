## üî¥ YouTube and Mobile Ad Domains
YouTube and mobile ad domains are used by advertisers to display ads on YouTube videos and mobile apps. While ads can be a source of revenue for content creators and app developers, they can also be intrusive and disruptive to the user experience. By blocking these domains with Pi-hole, you can enjoy an ad-free experience on your devices:

- googleadservices.com
- doubleclick.net
- googlesyndication.com
- adservices.google.com
- ad.doubleclick.net
- pagead2.googlesyndication.com
- pubads.g.doubleclick.net
