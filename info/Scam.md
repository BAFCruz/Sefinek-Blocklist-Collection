## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Scam Domains
Scam domains are websites that are designed to deceive people by promising them something that is too good to be true or by tricking them into giving away personal information or money. Scams can take many forms, including phishing, lottery scams, investment scams, and more. Scam websites often use tactics such as fake testimonials, pressure tactics, and urgent calls to action to convince people to fall for their schemes.

To protect yourself or others from scams, it's important to block access to scam domains. This can be done using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network. By adding a list of scam domains to Pi-hole, you can prevent users on your network from accessing these websites and potentially falling victim to scams.

Here's a sample list of scam domains that you can block in Pi-hole:
- secureincomenetwork.com
- myecom.club
- homecareer.online
- jobrize.com
- revenuejunction.com
- quickwork.online
- moneyjob.online

Please note that while blocking these domains may be an effective way to limit exposure to scam websites, it is important to also educate yourself on how to identify and avoid scams.
