## üïµÔ∏è Tracking Domains
Tracking domains are used by websites and advertisers to collect data on users' online behavior, such as what websites they visit, what products they search for, and what ads they click on. This information is then used to create targeted advertisements and personalize content.
While some users may be comfortable with this practice, others may consider it a violation of their privacy.
