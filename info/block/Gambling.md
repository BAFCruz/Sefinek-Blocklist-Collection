## üïπÔ∏è Gambling domains
Gambling domains are websites that offer online gambling services, such as sports betting, casino games, and poker.
These websites are often associated with addictive behavior and can lead to financial problems for those who become addicted to gambling.
To protect yourself or others from these negative consequences, it may be necessary to block access to gambling domains.
This can be done using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network.
By adding a list of gambling domains to Pi-hole, you can prevent users on your network from accessing these websites and potentially developing gambling addictions.

Please note that the following is a list of URLs available for blocking in Pi-hole, but it may not be comprehensive.
These URLs are associated with certain domains that you may wish to block on your network to improve online safety and reduce potential risks.
Please use this list as a reference and consider other measures to further enhance online safety.

Here are some sample URLs with a list of domains:
