## 📃 Information
Here is some additional information on pointless/unused domains:

- Pointless domains refer to websites that do not serve any significant purpose, contain no valuable content or services, and are often created just for the purpose of generating ad revenue or other forms of profit.
- Unused domains refer to registered domains that are not currently being used for any website or online service.
- Pointless and unused domains can have a negative impact on the overall health and security of the internet by clogging up search results, serving as a source of spam or malware, and contributing to overall digital clutter.
