## ü§° Drug domains
Drug-related domains are websites that provide information about illegal drugs or promote their use.
These websites are often associated with drug addiction and can have serious negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole. 
To protect yourself or others from these negative consequences, it may be necessary to block access to drug-related domains.

This can be done using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network.
By adding a list of drug-related domains to Pi-hole, you can prevent users on your network from accessing these websites and potentially developing drug addictions.

Please note that the following is a list of URLs available for blocking in Pi-hole, but it may not be comprehensive.
These URLs are associated with certain domains that you may wish to block on your network to improve online safety and reduce potential risks.
Please use this list as a reference and consider other measures to further enhance online safety.

Here are some sample URLs with a list of domains:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important information
Please note that while blocking drug-related domains may be an effective way to limit exposure to drug-related content, it is not a substitute for seeking professional help for drug addiction.
It is important to understand that addiction is a complex issue that requires individualized treatment and support.
Blocking websites may help in managing triggers, but it does not address the underlying causes of addiction.

If you or someone you know is struggling with drug addiction, please seek help from a licensed professional or a support group.
There are many resources available, including hotlines, online forums, and local treatment centers.
Remember, recovery is possible, and seeking help is the first step towards a healthier, happier life.
