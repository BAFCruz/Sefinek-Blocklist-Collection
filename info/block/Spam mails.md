## üì© Spam mail domains
Spam mail domains are websites that are known to send unsolicited and often fraudulent emails.
These emails can contain various types of scams, such as phishing attempts, malware distribution, and fake promotions.
Spam mail can be a major annoyance and can even be dangerous to your online security.

To protect yourself or others from the negative effects of spam mail, it may be necessary to block access to these websites.
This can be done using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network.
By adding a list of spam mail domains to Pi-hole, you can prevent users on your network from receiving these types of emails and potentially falling victim to scams.

Please note that the following is a list of URLs available for blocking in Pi-hole, but it may not be comprehensive.
These URLs are associated with certain domains that you may wish to block on your network to improve online safety and reduce potential risks.
Please use this list as a reference and consider other measures to further enhance online safety.
