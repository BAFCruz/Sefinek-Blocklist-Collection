## üõ°Ô∏è Domains with Malware
Malware domains are websites that are known to host or distribute malicious software such as viruses, trojans, ransomware, or spyware.
By blocking these domains with Pi-hole, you can prevent your devices from becoming infected with these harmful programs.

Here are some sample URLs with a list of domains:
