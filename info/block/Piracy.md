## üîí What are piracy domains?
Piracy domains are websites, servers, and services that are used to distribute copyrighted content such as movies, music, books, and computer games without permission from the copyright holders.
Accessing and downloading such content from these domains is illegal and can result in serious legal consequences.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
In addition to the legal implications, piracy domains can also be a major security threat.
They often host malware, phishing scams, and other malicious content that can harm your devices and compromise your personal information.
Moreover, visiting piracy domains can increase the risk of getting infected with viruses and other malware, which can cause your devices to slow down, crash, or become unstable.

To mitigate these risks, it's important to block piracy domains on your network.
By using Pi-hole, you can automatically block access to these domains and prevent your devices from accessing illegal and potentially harmful content.
This not only helps to protect your devices from malware and other security threats but also reduces the amount of network traffic that is generated by accessing these domains.
As a result, you can enjoy faster web browsing and a more efficient network.

## üö´ Why block piracy domains with Pi-hole?
Blocking piracy domains with Pi-hole is an effective way to prevent devices on your network from accessing illegal content and protecting them from malware and phishing attacks.
When a device on your network tries to access a piracy domain, Pi-hole blocks the request and prevents the device from accessing the illegal content.

Pi-hole can be easily configured to block piracy domains by adding blocklists, which are lists of known piracy domains that Pi-hole will block automatically.
By adding these blocklists to Pi-hole, you can protect your network from unwanted traffic and improve the overall performance of your network.

In addition to blocking piracy domains, Pi-hole can also block other types of unwanted content, such as ads, tracking scripts, and malicious websites, providing a comprehensive solution for protecting your network.
