## üì∞ Fake news domains
Fake news domains are websites that intentionally spread false or misleading information in order to manipulate public opinion or generate traffic for their own gain.
These websites can be a serious problem, as they can spread misinformation about important issues and undermine trust in reputable sources of information.

To protect yourself or others from the negative effects of fake news, it may be necessary to block access to these websites.
This can be done using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network.
By adding a list of fake news domains to Pi-hole, you can prevent users on your network from accessing these websites and potentially being misled by their content.

Please note that the following is a list of URLs available for blocking in Pi-hole, but it may not be comprehensive.
These URLs are associated with certain domains that you may wish to block on your network to improve online safety and reduce potential risks.
Please use this list as a reference and consider other measures to further enhance online safety.

Here are some sample URLs with a list of domains:

Please note that while blocking these domains may be an effective way to limit exposure to fake news content, it is important to also educate yourself on how to identify and avoid fake news.
