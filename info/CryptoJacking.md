## üßÆ Cryptojacking domains
Cryptojacking domains are websites that utilize the computing power of visitors' devices to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge or consent. These domains are often embedded with scripts that run in the background of a website, using visitors' CPU resources to mine cryptocurrency. Cryptojacking can slow down a device's performance and increase its power consumption, which can be costly and frustrating for users.

To protect your devices from cryptojacking, it may be necessary to block access to these domains. This can be done using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network. By adding a list of cryptojacking domains to Pi-hole, you can prevent your devices from being used for cryptocurrency mining without your knowledge.

Please note that the following is a list of URLs available for blocking in Pi-hole, but it may not be comprehensive. These URLs are associated with certain domains that you may wish to block on your network to improve online safety and reduce potential risks. Please use this list as a reference and consider other measures to further enhance online safety.
