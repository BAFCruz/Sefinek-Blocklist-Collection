## üçë Porn Domains
Pornography domains are websites that contain explicit sexual content, such as images, videos, and text. While there is nothing inherently wrong with pornography, these websites can sometimes be a problem, particularly when accessed by minors or in inappropriate contexts.

To protect yourself or others from the negative effects of pornography, it may be necessary to block access to these websites. This can be done using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network. By adding a list of pornography domains to Pi-hole, you can prevent users on your network from accessing these websites and potentially being exposed to explicit sexual content.

Here's a sample list of porn domains that you can block in Pi-hole:
- xvideos.com
- xhamster.com
- redtube.com
- youporn.com
- brazzers.com
- naughtyamerica.com
- realitykings.com
- twistys.com
- playboy.com

Please note that this is just a small sample of porn domains, and there are many more out there. It's important to keep your list up to date and to regularly review it to ensure that it is blocking the appropriate content.
