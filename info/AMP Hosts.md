## 🚫 AMP domains
AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) domains are used by Google to speed up mobile web browsing by stripping down web pages to their bare essentials. However, by doing so, they also limit the functionality of the web pages and can hinder user privacy. Here are some examples of AMP domains you might want to block:

- match.com
- eharmony.com
- okcupid.com
- zoosk.com
- tinder.com
- bumble.com
- hinge.co
- plentyoffish.com

By blocking these domains with Pi-hole, you can prevent your data from being shared with third-party companies without your consent, and also improve your browsing experience by avoiding stripped-down web pages.
