## üì© Spam mail domains
Spam mail domains are websites that are known to send unsolicited and often fraudulent emails. These emails can contain various types of scams, such as phishing attempts, malware distribution, and fake promotions. Spam mail can be a major annoyance and can even be dangerous to your online security.
