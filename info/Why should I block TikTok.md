## ü§î Why should I block TikTok?
TikTok is a social media platform that has been gaining a lot of popularity in recent years, particularly among younger generations.
It allows users to create short videos, typically around 15 seconds long, that can be edited with various effects, filters, and music.
TikTok has quickly become one of the most downloaded apps in the world, with over 1 billion active users.

However, TikTok has been the subject of controversy over concerns about privacy and security.
In 2020, the app was banned in India due to national security concerns, and the United States government considered a similar ban.

There are a number of reasons why people might choose to block TikTok in their home network using tools like [Pi-hole](./What%20is%20Pi-hole.md).
One major concern is the data that TikTok collects from its users.
The app collects a vast amount of data about its users, including their location, browsing history, and device information.
This data can be used for a variety of purposes, including targeted advertising.

Another concern is the way that TikTok handles this data.
There have been reports of the app sending data to servers in China, which has raised concerns about the Chinese government potentially having access to this data.
TikTok has denied these claims and has said that it stores user data in the United States and Singapore.

However, even if TikTok is not sending data to servers in China, there are still concerns about how the company handles user data.
In July 2020, TikTok was found to be accessing data on users' clipboards on iOS devices.
This means that the app was able to see and potentially store any text that users copied to their clipboard, including sensitive information like passwords.

There have also been concerns about the way that TikTok handles user accounts.
In August 2020, it was reported that the app was collecting biometric data from users without their consent.
This included data like facial recognition patterns and voiceprints.

Overall, there are a number of reasons why people might choose to block TikTok on their home network using tools like [Pi-hole](./What%20is%20Pi-hole.md).
While the app is popular and entertaining, its privacy and security practices have raised serious concerns.
Blocking TikTok can help to protect user data and prevent potentially sensitive information from being shared with the app's servers.
