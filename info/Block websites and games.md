Blocking these domains can be a good way to prevent users on your network from accessing these websites. However, it's important to note that blocking these domains will not completely prevent access to these websites, as they may be accessible through other domains or IP addresses. It's also important to keep in mind that blocking access to certain websites may not be effective in all situations, and it's always a good idea to educate yourself and others about online safety and responsible internet use.

It's also important to consider the reasons why you may want to block these domains. Blocking access to certain websites may be appropriate in some situations, but in other situations it may be better to use other strategies to address concerns about inappropriate content, cyberbullying, or other online safety issues.

Blocking access to specific domains can be a good first step, but there are other measures you can take to further enhance online safety. For example, you can use content filters and parental controls, educate yourself and others about online safety and responsible internet use, and monitor internet activity to identify potential issues.
