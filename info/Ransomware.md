## üò£ Ransomware Domains
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key. These attacks can be devastating, as the victim's files may be lost forever if the ransom is not paid. One way to protect against ransomware attacks is to block known domains associated with ransomware.

Here is a sample list of ransomware domains to block in Pi-hole:
- 0day.kiev.ua
- 17g1yytnmqb6gdcg.onion
- 1ms.org
- anarchyte.ch
- bitcoin-escrow-s2civcid.onion
- buybitcoins.site
- centralshop.cn
- cvvshop.lv
- darkweb.wtf
- drugsbitcoin.com
- en35tuzqmn4lofbk.onion.pet
