## üò£ Ransomware Domains
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key.
These attacks can be devastating, as the victim's files may be lost forever if the ransom is not paid.
One way to protect against ransomware attacks is to block known domains associated with ransomware.

Please note that the following is a list of URLs available for blocking in Pi-hole, but it may not be comprehensive.
These URLs are associated with certain domains that you may wish to block on your network to improve online safety and reduce potential risks.
Please use this list as a reference and consider other measures to further enhance online safety.
