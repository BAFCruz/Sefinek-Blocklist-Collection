## üïπÔ∏è Gambling domains
Gambling domains are websites that offer online gambling services, such as sports betting, casino games, and poker.
These websites are often associated with addictive behavior and can lead to financial problems for those who become addicted to gambling.
To protect yourself or others from these negative consequences, it may be necessary to block access to gambling domains.
This can be done using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network.
