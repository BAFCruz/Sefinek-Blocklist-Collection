    <h2 id="pihole">What is Pi-hole? üçí</h2>
    <div class="header-text">
        Pi-hole is not just an effective ad-blocking tool but also an intelligent guardian of privacy, ensuring the security of your data.
        <br>
        It operates at the DNS level, allowing it not only to eliminate annoying ads but also to protect against activity tracking and potential sources of malicious software.
        <br>
        Its ability to intercept unwanted content before it reaches devices enhances both the speed and security of internet usage.
        Moreover, Pi-hole enables filter customization and activity monitoring, giving users greater control over what is blocked.
        <br>

        Using Pi-hole not only enhances internet browsing comfort by eliminating ads but, more importantly, it significantly heightens privacy protection and data security.
    </div>


    <h2 id="adguard">What is AdGuard? ‚úÖ</h2>
    <div class="header-text">
        AdGuard employs a comprehensive approach to blocking unwanted content across web browsers and mobile applications, ensuring a seamless user experience.
        It offers user-friendly products such as browser extensions and mobile apps, available in both free and premium versions.
        In addition to content blocking, AdGuard provides built-in lists and is well-suited for parental control purposes.
        <br>
        The decision between Pi-hole and AdGuard hinges on your specific requirements.
        If you need a network-wide blocker, Pi-hole is the optimal solution.
        However, for application-based content blocking with added privacy features and built-in lists, especially designed for parental control, AdGuard stands as an excellent choice for a smooth, secure, and ad-free online experience.
