    <h2 id="pihole">What is Pi-hole? üçí</h2>
    <div class="header-text">
        Pi-hole is an all-encompassing network-wide solution that operates at the DNS level, offering far more than just ad-blocking. Its primary function is to eliminate unwanted advertisements and filter out potentially harmful domains for all devices within your network, ensuring a secure and ad-free online experience. While Pi-hole excels at ad-blocking, it offers extensive customization through personalized blocklists and whitelists. Moreover, it prioritizes your data privacy by ensuring it doesn't pass through third-party servers, giving you complete control over your ad-blocking system. This versatile tool isn't just about blocking ads; it's about enhancing your online privacy and security.

    <div class="header-text">
        AdGuard takes a granular approach to ad-blocking, focusing on filtering ads within web browsers and mobile applications with a seamless user experience. It provides a comprehensive range of user-friendly products, including browser extensions and mobile apps, available in both free and premium versions. In addition to ad-blocking, AdGuard extends its offerings to auxiliary services such as VPN and DNS protection, enhancing your online privacy. The choice between Pi-hole and AdGuard depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you require network-wide ad-blocking, Pi-hole is the ideal solution. However, if you prefer application-based ad blocking with the added advantages of privacy features, AdGuard is the perfect choice for a smooth, secure, and ad-free online experience.
