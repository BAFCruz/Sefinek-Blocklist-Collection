## üìù Information
False alarms occur very rarely.
If accidental blocking of a legitimate website occurs, please report it to its original Creator, as some lists in this repository ([blocklist/template/forks](blocklist/template/forks) directory) are only downloaded and converted into various formats.
Under no circumstances should they be modified because they will be overwritten by [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/download-blocklists.yml).
However, if a blocklist is not located in the aforementioned folder, you can create a new [Pull request](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/pulls) or [Issue](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/issues).

If I come across a false alarm while browsing the internet, I usually eliminate it immediately if it is within my capabilities.
