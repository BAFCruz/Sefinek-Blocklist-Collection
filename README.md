## üìù Information
False alarms happen very rarely. Even if accidental blocking of a website occurs, I usually create a new Issue in the repository with the original blocklist.
However, if the blocklist is of my own making, please open an Issue in this repository and inform me about the incident.
In any case, you can always create your Pull Request, which I always encourage. Any contribution will be appreciated by me.

You have two options to choose from. You can use the [default blocklist](lists/Index.md) or [visit my website](https://sefinek.net/blocklist-generator) and use the list generator.
You will be able to select exactly what should be blocked.

## ‚úã Warning
It is important to regularly check this repository for updates and potential changes.
However, it should be noted that while this blocking list can improve your privacy and security, it may unintentionally block legitimate content or services. Therefore, use it at your own risk.
