## üìù Information
False alarms occur very rarely.
If accidental blocking of a legitimate website occurs, please report it to its original Creator, as some lists in this repository ([blocklist/template/forks](blocklist/template/forks) directory) are only downloaded and converted into various formats.
Under no circumstances should they be modified because they will be overwritten by GitHub Actions.
However, if a blocklist is not located in the aforementioned folder, you can create a new Pull Request or Issue.

If I come across a false alarm while browsing the internet, I usually eliminate it immediately if it is within my capabilities.

**To summarize:**
- `blocklist/template/forks/*` - Files with lists downloaded by GitHub Actions and ready to be converted into various formats, e.g., from 0.0.0.0 example.com to another format. **DO NOT MODIFY** THEM, EVEN IF YOU CREATE A PULL REQUEST!
- `blocklist/template/*` - Modified copies of other blocklists or custom lists created for this repository. **You can modify** them as they will never be overwritten in the future.
- `blocklist/generated/*` - Blocklists generated in various formats from the template. **DO NOT MODIFY** ANY FILE IN THIS FOLDER!

> You have two options. You can use the [default blocklist](lists/Index.md) or [visit my website](https://sefinek.net/blocklist-generator) and use the list generator. You will be able to choose what should be blocked.


## ‚úã Warning
It is important to regularly check this repository for updates and potential changes.
However, it should be noted that while this blocking list can improve your privacy and security, it may unintentionally block legitimate content or services. Therefore, use it at your own risk.
