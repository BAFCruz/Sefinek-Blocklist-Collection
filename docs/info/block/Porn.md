## üçë Porn Domains
Pornography domains are websites that contain explicit sexual content, such as images, videos, and text.
While some individuals may not see anything wrong with pornography, it can be a problem, particularly when accessed by minors or in inappropriate contexts.

To protect yourself or others from the potential negative effects of pornography, it may be necessary to block access to these websites.
This can be achieved using tools like Pi-hole, which can block specific domains from being accessed on your network.
By adding a list of pornography domains to Pi-hole, you can prevent users on your network from accessing these websites and potentially being exposed to explicit sexual content.

Please note that the following is a list of URLs available for blocking in Pi-hole, but it may not be comprehensive.
These URLs are associated with certain domains that you may wish to block on your network to improve online safety and reduce potential risks.
Please use this list as a reference and consider other measures to further enhance online safety.
